It’s been years since I have gotten a good night’s sleep. But I have come a long way in 352 days. Hard to believe I’m coming up on 1 year in this home. This new life. I will never forget the nights laying down on nothing but folded over 2 ply cardboard from the pallet factory across the street. My mind wanders, and it’s like I am there again. The smell of piss seeping through the fibers of the tent. Ting. Ting. Ting. Why in God’s name did I use aluminum foil to patch those holes? “Snap out of it Russell” I say under my breath. I look in the mirror, eyes locked into the reflection of my face, and say out loud, “I have found peace. I know what has to be done to set me free.” I grabbed the single towel left in the cabinet and sat it on the rim of the sink. Hard to believe this will be my last shower here.

I have finally found my purpose. No more being a victim, feeling sorry for myself. I am a changed man. I have a support system now. I have God. I am a soldier for God. And I know exactly what I need to do. I noticed a pattern in the shower tile that has never presented itself to me before now. The white lines in the faux marble tile looked like a fork in a creek, with a row of Pine trees on one side and the other abruptly ending as the pattern repeated itself. Huh, so strange; I was just talking with Brother Ben about scything yesterday in the fellowship hall. He told me wild stories about staring into the fire. How it has shown him the way.

I reached for my towel, patted dry, tossed the towel on the floor. I can’t believe the day has come. I limp towards the bed and take a good look around. And twist the knob of the lamp. I run through the plan over and over again in my head…

I knew that I should have used the VPN to download the Army of the God Manual, but I figured it was an honest download. Yet, as I looked out the crack of the drape, I could clearly see the FBI executing a knock and seize warrant. I couldn’t let my real work get taken. By my calculations that gave me a good forty seconds to wipe the drives and execute the kill switch to disperse the cloud network. I locked the door to my room, giving me maybe ten more seconds, and keyed in the commands to start the process...

And poof… I wake up. Feeling like I never slept a wink. I always have vivid dreams, but nothing like this one. I lay there, dumbfounded. Just trying to recall the dream. Grasping at the crystal clear details that are ever so quickly disintegrating. I sit up. I kiss the picture on the bedside table. The sun is shining so bright through the crack in the curtains. A single ray shines in from the top corner of the window, through the weeping fig on the dresser and all the way across the bed. I took a big swig of water. “This is it”. I say quietly.

I laid out my outfit the night before to get out the door by 6am sharp. The clinic opens at 7 on Thursdays, and I need to be there first. It’s only a 3-minute walk from my unit. The security guard will be there at 6:25. That will give me plenty of time to make the connections and get to my hiding place. I tossed the towel in the iron mountain box along with my laptop, charging cord, sheets, and pajamas. Jerry will come by and collect the mattress and the box to burn tomorrow afternoon after the chaos subsides. God would not give me a task I cannot handle, nor an unjust purpose.
