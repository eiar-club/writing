What more is a routine than a string of habits? Habits are the the dna of the routine. What is our life but the sum of the habits we keep? Isn’t it something to consider that we all have habits. Routines. It’s in our nature. A natural mechanism, hard coded it seems. What is the purpose? If it can literally lead to our demise with surgical precision. But we always have the potential to choose. To shift the momentum. Why is it that shifting from destructive to constructive seems like such an insurmountable feat while the inverse happens as effortlessly as a rock that falls to the ground when dropped. Pleasure. Why is breaking a bad habit such an arduous effort? Yet one can erase a lifetime of progression with one misstep? Why? Why is life this way? Why can we so easily lose control? Control of what? How does one lose control of one’s own behavior? Routine is a way to make sense of the chaotic nature of the world. Order in chaos. Like a house plant stretching for the sun.
