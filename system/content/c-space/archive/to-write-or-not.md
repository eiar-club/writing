Recording information, discovering oneself and beyond, communication and art are the first mechanisms that come to mind. A full spectrum of possibilities. I drift to the idea of how a consistent practice of writing daily can exponentially improve my life and others around me. The endeavor is probably the the most impactful action One can take in this life. It’s a selfish act in that I want to learn more about thy self, develop thy intellect, improve thy ability to communicate, and to formulate thyself to the world. I believe if one can know thyself truly, peace emanates far beyond the self. To know thyself is to know everyone else. Empathy. Love not fear.

Writing seems to me, to be a form of thinking, with more order and responsiblilty. Forcing one to deal with the thoughts arising in the mind. It seems easy to suppress memories, ideas or thoughts when they are kept in one’s head. They can simply be toned down or even shut off. Placed in the human data cloud, never to be dealt with. It seems, when we begin to write, type or record we are able to format an idea or concept in a way that we can properly focus on it. Order arising from the chaos of our thoughts.

I think about the times in my life when I have turned to writing as self care. I remember buying my first “journal” when my mom passed. Before then I found myself balling on a flight from Tampa to Indianapolis. Confronting my reality. I opened up my phone and started typing. I felt it was imperative to express how I was feeling. To release those thoughts in some visible form.
