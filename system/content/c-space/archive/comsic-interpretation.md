I keep getting served the same ad over and over again on Twitter. This little Greta Thornberg looking bitch connecting all the dots like she is RainMan in the flesh. So annoying. I throw the phone into the pillow. I fucking hate these grey walls. Why couldn’t the previous owner have fucking painted them a different color. I should call Dare’El and see about borrowing his neuro-boost. There’s a new download available for premium platinum plus users. Dare’El throws me his scraps every now and again. The ad describes it as a cosmic interpretation. Your mind, how it was designed to operate. I have done little upgrades here and there but nothing like this. There is no going back. And there are risks. What they don’t mention in their Tweeble Twabble posts is that 10% of users have what they call a blank canvas effect. Where your entire identity is wiped clean. They spend big dolla Bill bytes to suppress the stories. Some say Tweeble Twabble is funded by Neuro-boost. I don’t buy it. I laid back in my sleep net and buttoned the device to the back or my neck. Navigated through the module got comfortable and pressed begin.
