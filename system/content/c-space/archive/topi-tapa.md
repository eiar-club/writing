We just sat down for a proper brunch when the shroomies kicked in. Jared kept going on and on about his uncle’s private lagoon down in Mexico. Apparently they were raising hounds. Who knew they had Beagles that far south of the border. He bragged about the high ceilings. “Techo Alto” he said proudly. Then he said we could take the boat out any time, that his uncle stayed with a gaggle of hoes. So Barry, who drove us to brunch, proposed we take a road trip. We were floating by this time. I mean ass in the sky looking down and up at the same time. So we were like fuck it. It’s only 18 hours to Topi Tapa. Let’s do this shit. Barry brought his ratty ass friend Gus because he said he drives cross Country and would be the driver if he could come. Last thing I remember is screaming highway to hell with my head out the sunroof. I woke up in a strange place. Turns out we made it All to Abilene.
