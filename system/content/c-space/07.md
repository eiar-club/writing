What do you see when you look in the mirror?

For some reason I don’t see the physical. I immediately internalize the observation of the external. Or at least that’s what I thought would happen when I spent some time in the mirror. Like I would have to face myself. And get a glimpse of the sucker who can’t control himself. Instead the noise silenced. I was grounded. I see potential. Potential in the essence of that which My energy and physical manifestation can create and consume. 

This is how I appear to others. Or pretty damn close. I can see my arm. My fingers. My bitch. They look the same in the mirror.  I look closely into my own eyes. They say you can tell a lot about a man by looking him in the eyes. What is that sensory mechanism? Maybe our ancestors could better express it. Looking another life form in the eyes produces empathy, furthermore a bond. Maybe looking in the eyes of another actually tells us more about ourself?

I am feeling whole after seeing myself. I feel a responsibility to fulfill that which I can. That which I know to be true. Take care of myself as I would care for another. 

Maybe I need to have this face to face more often. It’s Like I haven’t seen myself in ages. 

Be gentle. Be kind. Listen. Respect. Speak truthfully. Let love be the force.
