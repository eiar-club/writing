Somber is the mood as the blood moon rises. The burning sun now gone replaced with the quite of night. The bats and the skunks end their slumber and slank forward to forage. The last heat of the day drains form the world leaving the cold of the void to penetrate existence.

I lyeath and fake it all in resignation to forgoing old habits and embracing the change that will bring with it the fruits of chaos. Fat with ripeness and ready to be devoured. A sweet treat on a cool night. I close my eyes then open them and close them again. I open my eye and gaze. With the gaze enters clarity, the calm vibe felt at the base that loosens the shoulders. My head extends to the heavens. I toke. I am ready. From this comes everything and nothing. A weird state for a weird time. I shall find peace and it will be a reflection of myself.
