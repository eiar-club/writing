# Routine

WAKNE

Removing time from the equation, I exist in one of two states. The first instance is a state of nothing. Much has been said and written and believed about this state. For now I will call it bliss and move on.

The second state is one that represents a word that would not do it justice. Some have called this state's primordial essence as one of chaos. It is more but for now that shall suffice.

You could easily sum it up as: we are nothing or we are everything.

In this situation there is a slight advantage to everything, in a marginal way. The mere usage of the word everything is a deception. Everything implies everything but nothing. This is an important distinction because nothing implies nothing.

Somewhere I come into play with time as a fulcrum. I am the one difference between the two. I am the true.

In this slowly fast temporal temperament chaos is separated into the seemingly smallest of instances. A near perfect snapshot of the energy in play across the entire known universe. The rock, patience as ever withers before the storm. Our lives, so uniquely small.

Yes, it must be chaos. I do not believe in nothing. I give it no presence as it would desire. Let it die as a myth that only primitives believed. Let Old Man bide his slumber.

I put my coffee down. I reach for it but it is not there.

This is routine at play. Within the chaos begins to emerge patterns. Everyday I have put my coffee down and everyday I have picked it back up. Today however, routine has left me grasping for air.

These routines emerge throughout our lifes. Deep connections we are not conscious of are imprinted in our brains at birth and beyond. At any point in time exists another branch of near realities that spew across the time chaos fulcrum. Perhaps the rocks wither as quickly as we do.

To say chaos is everything at once would be an error, as once introduced to time chaos becomes nothing. Since chaos is everything, it knows everything. That is a rough language to usage around what chaos knows, but essentially chaos is the essence of everything. At it's root level is the base of limitless potential from which everything is derived and that loops around directly above it that which is everything. To call it linear is a mistake, think of it more as single point of space, or beyond.

It is the simplest to say chaos knows everything, as that is the imprint we most closely connect to. It does not do the reality justice but yet it butts against the very understanding of man.

One non-linear connection is our routines. These routines are easy for us to see and understand. We pick up the coffee and then we put it down. Once a day, every morning. From this one node of chaos runs close connections. To think of them as matter is a mistake. It more closely mirrors human thought. In this way I am the one.

I begin to target large routines and the chaos within them. I sever the possibilities I do not wish and bolster those which bring me benefit. In the chaos I am born.
