Five. The number is five. The golden number is five. The holy ratio, the math which speaks to our souls. On the surface it seems unassuming, just another simple thing however upon closer examination there is another current that runs hot with electricity. With that realization is another that reveals there is something greater than ourselves. Not our environment, not our genetics, but something greater than all of us.

Some find this comforting, others find this threating. I simply believe in the number five. The hum is there one only has to close their eyes and open their ears. Their heart. It will come slowly but it will come. Distractions surround us but slowly as they cease it becomes more and more apparent. It is up to you to embrace the five and make it part of you. To become one with that is more tha everything.
