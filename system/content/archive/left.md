I guess that is how it is going to be. It doesn't always go your way but sometimes it does. It's how you roll with the punches, and it's how you celebrate when it is time. Sometimes they worship you when you down and sometimes they worship you when you up. The key is to read the room and then apply the correct leverage. In the end the simplest machines end up being the most complex. A big enough fulcrum can move the world, or so someone smart once said.

Another key point to remember is that it's not all jazz. When you first hear it you will think it is but there is another layer beneath the surface that rings at a different vibration. And one beneath that. And one beneath that. No one knows how deep and some say it goes on forever. Not sure forever is even a concept that lies true, but it's fixed in the mix. You have to take what your given and work it out best you can. It's all you have.
