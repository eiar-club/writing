I knew that I should have used the VPN to download the Army of the God Manual but I figured it was an honest download. Yet, as I looked out the crack of the drape I could clearly see the FBI executing a knock and seize warrant. I couldn't let my real work get taken. By my calculations that gave me a good forty seconds to wipe the drives and execute the kill switch to disperse the cloud network. I locked the door to my room, giving me maybe ten more seconds and keyed in the commands to start the process.

The instant I hit enter the world pulsed cascading bolts of pain up my spine terminating at the tip of my skull sending me to one knee. Existence digitized for one second on the screen. No, it wasn't a screen, it was the world. That wasn't right either, I searched as the term fled from my mind's tongue. Aether Rig. Yes, that was right.

No, that wasn't right. Nothing was right. Through the cacophony of visual violence I re-centered my mind using the technique that Jorq, or whatever the fuck his name was, had taught me.

I attempted to look at the monitor and judge the progress. I say attempted because it felt like labor, the heavy kind. The locked door was in the past, I was back down to forty. Things were not going great.

I pulled out the gun from the drawer. It wasn't big but it didn't need to be. It might buy me another ten seconds. As I sat it down on the desk, that's when things got really weird.

A voice called out,

"Michael, come home".
"Michael, come home".

The Aether Rig? whirled with a thousand or more possibilities. The main reoccurrence was me standing up with a sly smile on my mouth and empty eyes, quickly, over and over slightly differently, bringing the gun to my head. Pulling the trigger. Time moving so slowly as the bullet primed. Then quickly as it would load again. Maybe more like a million possibilities.

Evidently it takes five seconds to pull a gun out of drawer and another two to trip on a lifetime of alternatives. I doubled my intent with the centering technique, bringing my forearm to my mouth and biting as hard as I could. Or was that the demon possession again playing out another side of my body?

The warm taste of iron touched the back of throat bringing clarity that the twonce re-center was in effect. It could last up to an hour, but who had time for that.


I looked at the progress it was halfway done. Eighteen seconds left. 31% progress. For some reason I had always been able to keep numbers in my head. Was it a blessing or a curse. Who knew?

Regardless, the fifteen seconds I had lost on twoncing didn't exist in my head. It had a taken a lifetime. So many I had forgot.

The re-centering didn't clear but was good enough. I still had strong visual tracers and block textured extreme peripheral vision glances at the edge of sight. I pulled up the command prompt quickly. I entered the kill switch command which released the proper public crypto keys to be released and at the time of my death my friends were authorized to release thw private key.  Maybe they are friends, who knows.

I would normally have only trusted an AI. Yet, here we are with AI being really bad at telling if someone was alive or dead, at least until someone told them.  No, human beings would be the only way and the only human I trusted would be dead in the event of a dead man switch activation. So I called them friends.

Elsewhere, the knock had gone well and the goons where now at the seize part of their program. Already a crowd had gathered at the inner door and now they were angry. I could hear the big one position to use his ram, his big horns bristling with adrenaline and warrants of the state, absolution from sin.

Some would say I wasted those four seconds I took to inhale deeply, as if I was starting my exercise. I reached down and grabbed the pistol. The first one through caught a bullet. He appeared very heavily armoured. The others took the sign of aggression as a termination order.

Time came to a stop as the first bullet pierced the flesh of my forehead, just in a slice of time, gently touching the bone of my skull. The whole world had froze. I could see the bullets clearly in the air, the pellets from the shotgun would show up last. The white powder trails from the gusn. The ripples of mass through the soldier's body as they ate the recoil.  The Aethir Rig slightly muted with marks of tension at the sides.

A voice called out,

"Michael, come home".
"Michael, come home".


The screen read "Upload Complete". I tarried for an infinite second then died.
