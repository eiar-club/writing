George had told me there was no way in hell he was going to follow through with this and I would have to find someone else. And I did. I told him I would and I thought we had an understanding but evidently there was still some bad blood there. I could feel it. I wanted this so bad and he was merely along for the ride. We both knew it. Somewhere along the way he lost interest or caught feelings and it didn't matter to me one way or the other, I always thought he would follow through and that is why I kept him around. The instant I finally looked up and realized what was so obvious was the same day George was out.

I think I'm growing a little soft. I find myself missing George. However, the few times i've sought answers it has always led me to believe that it was my own lack of awareness and honestly my sheer lack of intellect that allowed myself to get embroiled into relationships. It was a problem I always struggled with, at least the last part.

Nonetheless I had used my time wisely and efficiently, at least the time I was given. Life hurtles a person always forward with little care of our timelines. The problem was George felt like life and maybe I had stolen a little from him. I was never one to cook or clean but George was always there to pick up the slack. Mundane as it was.

Committed is maybe the best word to fit my endeavor. Others tanned in bikinis and smiles while I studied and planned my vacations around old dusty libraries. Such sacrifices rarely go unanswered and I finally found the key that had eluded so many others.

These being my personal memoirs, I omit the plans but they can be found in Grimoire Nine Order Seven.

My new assistant, whom I shall leave nameless, will soon help me disrobe and begin the experiment. She is a fine assistant but one still has doubt that maybe only with George could should a task succeed. I had once believed that but now I am unsure. Doubt can only sow doubt. Getting caught up in your own experiment is always weird but even I would have to admit that maybe I had gone a little too far this time.
