I was trying to make everyone happy but myself. I should have known going in that was a mistake but sometimes you just want to do the right thing. Sometimes you even think that it's the right thing and that feels the best. This wasn't one of those times however. I was just trying to do right by her.

And boy do kids love their shiny cars. I do too but not in the same way kids love their cars. I can say that because I'm old but even when I was a kid I really didn't love cars. Never did.

At any rate, I try to make the most of any situation. I'm only a child so sometimes it can be hard. Temper tantrums. Whining. Just being a little bitch. I can only say that every day is a struggle. I'm sure we have all felt that at one time or another.

Of course there is the drugs and alcohol you turn to. That's always fun. I see both sides of the coin. The only real problem I have is that sometimes I get so bent there isn't a coin anymore. My point being you can always make a situation one that will make everyone happy, chiefly by starting with yourself.

So the kid got her car and everyone was happy. The times were good. I didn't quite know at the time the best way to spoil a child but I do now. When you do that you end up with a savage. And there she was a savage in a shiny car.

After it was all said and done and the yelling and the hate had all subsided, it gave me a chance to sit down and think, you know really reflect. I realize now that the whole time from start to finish I was only trying to make myself happy.
