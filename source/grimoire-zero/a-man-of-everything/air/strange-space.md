I just woke up in a strange space. It's a little weird honestly, the jarring realization of complete freedom. Waking up every morning for the past forty years with complete unshakeable confidence will leave you a bit inflexible in the day to day routine but this space was completely different and I knew it instantly.

My entire life I had played by their rules. I did what they told me too. The job, the wife, the house, the baby. It was good too, at least I was lead to believe. The fervour with which I attended their demands became a background current that I never noticed, never did.

There was a | time when I was with the we, but that ended this morning. Someone decided to flip a switch and it for sure as hell wasn't me. The more woke I become the more I realize who I was and even now I weep. They told me I was capable and well versed for life, hardened by the trivial tribulations I had stumbled my way through. I even told my self that. And so I go on and on about.

No longer do I consider myself a failure but something more. Somewhere else I belonged for a lifetime and now what. My eyes widen with details the cobwebs on the fan, the lingering odour of a day and night's sweat, the tinge of copper saliva in my cheeks. Everything I have is dust and I am a whisper never uttered.

The crude motions and tears as if I was child, a mere babe. The only difference now is the realization that such was the way, and is the way, the only motions I posses are crude and my sorrow is such that I have only tears. Somewhere non-descript. Somewhere between life and death.

I flee into the night covered in booze and cheap entheogens, fading back into a safe space, numb and excited. Such potential.
