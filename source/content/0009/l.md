# Page Intentionally Thrown Away

Imagine pushing your way up through the jungles to wake up to this mess. It's fine for some I guess. The tall dark and shirtless. That's the way we like it anyway. The man we would hero worship. Fit and tan. Maybe a cowboy?  That's just for half of the population. The better sex has always been undecipherable at the best of times and suddenly you have to be all those things plus wear makeup and walk around in heels. Seems unfair.

It's always been a little complex and it is not stopping any time soon. We are all walking around a little crazy and not the funny haha wild kinda way but clinical mental illness. It is hard to imagine and even harder to accept but it only makes medical sense.

At the very least we have all been deluded, myself most of all. I have deluded myself into thinking others might think. It appears thinking is strictly a thinker's game. One does not just casually think for pleasure. Only the most baseless unthinking creature would not understand that the pedestals we once built have become our prisons.

Give praise where praise is due. Raise accolades and feast. Let us live and then die. Raise no legends. Let the dead lay in the past as lessons learned. We have already unlearned so much. Let the knowledge we once knew rekindle in our soul. Let us be free.

We have chosen what we think is most important. We are our own disease that ravages through humanity. At this rate only the strong willed will survive. Well, that and the cowboy and his rider.

I look at the page. No cure. I take it out and crumple it up. Throwing it at the waste can I yell Kobe. The paper hits the rim but does not land.
