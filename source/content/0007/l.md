# MIRO

It is rather odd that you would ask me what you see when you look in the mirror?

I know what I see when I look in the mirror. The brilliance that is myself. These big beautiful ruby eyes, crossed in Ssss. My slim figure and my goatee. It's all physical really. It's what the ladies like.

Through my eyes however, if you could take a closer look, you would see something deeper, my very thoughts. The cold bioluminescence my body produces throbing with them. You can see clearly see my brain and my brain can see you. The Ssss are there for looks. At least that is what I was taught growing up. Who really knows?

 It's my brain eye that sees everything through the red gelatinous haze. It's the one that speaks.

Normally I would be a predator but we refined the use of psychoactive scriptions that when consumed unlocks hidden evolution in ones dna. These cosmic triggers are cultivated and perfected. Our civilization would be less without I fear. Even those who once had doubts are now illuminated. We all live together in harmony.

That it is why it is odd to speak to a human and for him to ask what do I see when you look in the mirror.

I know what it is reflected in the mirror. I see the brilliance that is myself. Ssss hanging brilliantly in the sun reflecting the ruby haze. Fit. Happy. Loved.
