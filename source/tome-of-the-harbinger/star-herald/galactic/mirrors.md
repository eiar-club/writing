It’s Like I haven’t seen myself in ages. Immediately, I internalize the observation of the external. At least that is what I expected to happen. I would have to face myself, get a glimpse of he who can’t control himself. Instead the noise silenced. I was grounded. I see potential. Potential in the essence of that which My energy and physical manifestation can create and consume.

This is how I appear to others. Or pretty damn close. I can see my arm. My fingers. My nose. They look the same in the mirror.  I look deeper into my  eyes. They say you can tell a lot about a man by looking him in the eyes. What is that sensory mechanism? Maybe our ancestors could better express it. Looking another life form in the eyes produces empathy, furthermore a bond. Maybe looking in the eyes of another actually tells us more about ourself?

I am feeling whole after seeing myself. I feel a responsibility to fulfill that which I can. That which I know to be true. Let love be the force.
