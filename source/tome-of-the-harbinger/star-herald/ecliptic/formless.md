Facts can’t speak for themselves

So let us try and clarify

I’m alex Jones at the grove

Man I’m Feeling terrified

Began from primitive squalor

Sustained higher standards of living

But worship a paper dollar

Pressed to find food, I’m isolated

Confined, remote have to fight to make it

They say that Genius

buds from fertile lands

Now we frequent the strip club

With them rubber bands

I’m on strictly potion

Stick to the motions

I’m somewhere remote

Sitting by the ocean

  .  

Let’s mAke a sharp distinction

Influence and determinism

it’s got me thinkin

Man it’s Got me thinking

A peculiar time and place

Looking in my mirror

And I’m staring at my face

What do I really see

My finger starts to trace

While I’m here

I might as well make my case

And then my mind escapes

Breaking boundaries

Between dimension time and space
