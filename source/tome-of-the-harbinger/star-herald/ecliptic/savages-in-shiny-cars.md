Homo Sapiens. Translates to wise man. I wonder who gave them that name??? (‘Sarcasm’). The only surviving species of the genus homo. For 2 million years homo erectus walked the earth. Upright man.. It’s hard to imagine the landscape when they were roaming in small packs. Middle of the food chain. What happened? It’s commonly agreed upon... ahh the collective acceptance of what is. It’s commonly agreed upon that there was a genetic mutation. The Tree of knowledge mutation. Igniting the cognitive revolution. Animals now able to communicate in a common tongue. This ability to communicate complexly with one another had us conquer the globe. Transmitting Information about that which does not exist. I guess it comes from the need to survive. Where is the line drawn between survival and greed? What will we do to survive? What will we do for power? For status? Imagine the night sky looming. Sniffling. Fingers numb. Shivering. Wet. Yet eyes wide open. Ears like a stethoscope enveloping the surrounding forest. In the elements. Just you and a small group if you are lucky. What will you do to eat? To feed the group? What would be the natural instinct if another group approached? It makes me think of the stories about the first contacted tribes of the Amazon. They will kill your ass before you ever see a soul. This is who we were for millions of years. Now look at us. Civilized. Fresh shaven. Sipping bottled alkaline water.
