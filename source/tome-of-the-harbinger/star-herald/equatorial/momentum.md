Here I am. As always with a choice to make. A universal choice. To be mindful or not. Do I go watch the tv for 4 hours and go to bed as I have done the last 3 nights or do I think? I just spent the last 10 minutes talking to myself in the shower. I have heard a few people mention talking to themselves in the past few days. Both in favor. I agree. It’s an exercise. Thinking aloud. Quite different of an experience, the voice in your head and the words you speak. Especially when you are talking to yourself about your self. Feels a little less sharp aloud. Slower even. Back when I was giving all of my energy to becoming a better basketball player, I was once told that to get better, you have to go fast enough where you would mess up. While practicing of course. Pushing the boundaries of ability. I need to talk to myself more.

It feels like i am at a crucial point in time and space. The momentum always going one way or another. Mostly powered by our decisions. And I have been fucking up. It is unsustainable. I am not who I think I am. My thoughts of who I need and desire to be have tricked me into believing that is who I am.  Don’t get me wrong. I feel the disappointment in myself constantly and lately it is more concentrated than ever. But I don’t spend the time reflecting. Thinking. Seeking solutions to why I am acting contrary to what I know to be righteous and vital. I quickly turn on a podcast. Blow up a bag. Scroll Twitter. I have to figure out what the fuck is going on in my mind to be so distant from the man I want to be.
