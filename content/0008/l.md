# Technique Z017

[Theta Binaural]

The Fears. The Overthinking. The worries. You have to let it go. There is another pathway. Convert your mind as if the tabula rasa. The blank slate. Once experienced, Gnosis is easy to identify. It is from this state that one truly becomes open. As we go through this exercise one will begin to feel more relaxed. Take this opportunity to embrace the change and become more relaxed. If one must, take each muscle and unwind it mentally, physically and spiritualty.

One may start from the toes to the heels and up the body or start in the face and make their way down. The face and the eyes carry undue tension. Unwind everything. Advanced practitioners my alternate sides of the body either choosing to alternate hemispheres or forming a horseshoe. Anyone can easily let all their muscles go formless at once. Free your body so your mind will shine. You are feeling the presence of the sacred trinity of mind body and spirit. Embrace that presence and now let your mind go. Focus on your spirit.

Nothing is left. What was once is no more. Transformation has been achieved. Your existence has been transmuted into a singular line that loops upon itself forever. Your relaxed body and mind understand that all things are possible. From your spirit shines a soul of light. Embrace the halo.

You are open now. There is another pathway. And another. And another. Pathways extend into infinity. This is the word they call bliss but means something different. Here all things are possible. Embrace this change.

Let get of spirit. Open yourself even more. The line has become a point that recedes into forever. The deeper you go the more you realize everything minus one. You are the one and the nothing. Fully open yourself. Completely surrender. Be nothing. Be all. Embrace this everything.
