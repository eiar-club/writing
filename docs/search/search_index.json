But I have come a long way in 352 days. Hard to believe I\u2019m coming up on 1 year in this home. This new life. I will never forget the nights laying down on nothing but folded over 2 ply cardboard from the pallet factory across the street. My mind wanders, and it\u2019s like I am there again. The smell of piss seeping through the fibers of the tent. Ting. Ting. Ting. Why in God\u2019s name did I use aluminum foil to patch those holes? \u201cSnap out of it Russell\u201d I say under my breath. I look in the mirror, eyes locked into the reflection of my face, and say out loud, \u201cI have found peace. I know what has to be done to set me free.\u201d I grabbed the single towel left in the cabinet and sat in on the rim of the sink. Hard to believe this will be my last shower here. I have finally found my purpose. No more being a victim, feeling sorry for myself. I am a changed man. I have a support system now. I have God. I am a soldier for God. And I know exactly what I need to do. I noticed a pattern in the shower tile that has never presented itself to me before now. The white lines in the faux marble tile looked like a fork in a creek, with a row of Pine trees on one side and the other abruptly ending as the pattern repeated itself. Huh, so strange; I was just talking with Brother Ben about scything yesterday in the fellowship hall. He told me wild stories about staring into the fire. How it has shown him the way. I reached for my towel, patted dry, tossed the towel on the floor. I can\u2019t believe the day has come. I limp towards the bed and take a good look around. And twist the knob of the lamp. I run through the plan over and over again in my head\u2026 I knew that I should have used the VPN to download the Army of the God Manual, but I figured it was an honest download. Yet, as I looked out the crack of the drape, I could clearly see the FBI executing a knock and seize warrant. I couldn\u2019t let my real work get taken. By my calculations that gave me a good forty seconds to wipe the drives and execute the kill switch to disperse the cloud network. I locked the door to my room, giving me maybe ten more seconds, and keyed in the commands to start the process... And poof\u2026 I wake up. Feeling like I never slept a wink. I always have vivid dreams, but nothing like this one. I lay there, dumbfounded. Just trying to recall the dream. Grasping at the crystal clear details that are ever so quickly disintegrating. I sit up. I kiss the picture on the bedside table. The sun is shining so bright through the crack in the curtains. A single ray shines in from the top corner of the window, through the weeping fig on the dresser and all the way across the bed. I took a big swig of water. \u201cThis is it\u201d. I say quietly. EXTENDED PICK YOUR ENDING: A. I laid out my outfit the night before to get out the door by 6am sharp. The clinic opens at 7 on Thursdays, and I need to be there first. It\u2019s only a 3-minute walk from my unit. The security guard will be there at 6:25. That will give me plenty of time to make the connections and get to my hiding place. I tossed the towel in the iron mountain box along with my laptop, charging cord, sheets, and pajamas. Jerry will come by and collect the mattress and the box to burn tomorrow afternoon after the chaos subsides. God would not give me a task I cannot handle, nor an unjust purpose. The end. B. For the first time since joining, I have a quick thought of doubt. Would Ly\u2019 el be proud of me? What am I doing? It hit me like a ton of bricks.","title":"B"},{"location":"content/0001/l/","text":"Upload Complete I knew that I should have used the VPN to download the Army of the God Manual but I figured it was an honest download.

As always with a choice to make. A universal choice. To be mindful or not. Do I go watch the tv for 4 hours and go to bed as I have done the last 3 nights or do I think? I just spent the last 10 minutes talking to myself in the shower. I have heard a few people mention talking to themselves in the past few days. Both in favor. I agree. It\u2019s an exercise. Thinking aloud. Quite different of an experience, the voice in your head and the words you speak. Especially when you are talking to yourself about your self. Feels a little less sharp aloud. Slower even. Back when I was giving all of my energy to becoming a better basketball player, I was once told that to get better, you have to go fast enough where you would mess up. While practicing of course. Pushing the boundaries of ability. I need to talk to myself more. It feels like i am at a crucial point in time and space. The momentum always going one way or another. Mostly powered by our decisions. And I have been fucking up. It is unsustainable. I am not who I think I am. My thoughts of who I need and desire to be have tricked me into believing that is who I am. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I feel the disappointment in myself constantly and lately it is more concentrated than ever. But I don\u2019t spend the time reflecting. Thinking. Seeking solutions to why I am acting contrary to what I know to be righteous and vital. I quickly turn on a podcast. Blow up a bag. Scroll Twitter. I have to figure out what the fuck is going on in my mind to be so distant from the man I want to be. I suppose this is a start. I could be scrolling Twitter and sucking down a bag while watching the office. I could also be working on the writing prompt for the week. Breeze on the shore of crystal clear lake under the moonlight I have a great story that sparked the idea for this prompt. It was shortly after another major turning point in my life. My mom had just passed, we just hit a lick, got out of subway and moved to Birmingham. I had decided I was going to soak up every bit of life. Cherish every single moment. Have fun. So I convinced a friend to take a 4 week trip to the Pacific Northwest to connect with nature and ourselves. It felt incredible to be fortunate enough to have the freedom of time to make that call. To be able to disconnect from the stream of data coming at us every waking hour. It was a rich experience. But one of my favorite memories is our first night. Our flights arrived at SEA within 30 minutes of one another. We linked in the terminal and were both all smiles. We were about to explore uncharted territory and embark on a once in a lifetime experience. We got the rental and hit up a Walmart in a shitty suburb of Seattle. Had to grab some essentials because we were hitting the cascade loop for 5 nights of camping and hiking. Pulling out of the lot a fellow Walmart patron backs right into the back passenger door. Fuck! After 5-10 seconds of frustration we start cracking up. What can we do? It happened and here we are. We still about to go out and have an unbelievable time as soon as we do get out of this hell hole. So we fuck around for an hour dealing with it and finally hit road. We spend a few hours driving as the sun is going down. The road is weaving up, down around a sea of pine trees. And then it\u2019s pitch black. We started talking about bears right before pulling into the camp ground. I was a little fearful to be separated by the nylon of ozark tent we just bought. That wouldn\u2019t matter shortly. We slowly twist and turn through the narrow park road winding through the pine forest and as we get close to our site the trees fan out leaving an expansive view. The full moon reflecting off of the water and brightening all of the landscape in sight. It was like we entered a different world. We got the tent set up. Grabbed a quick campground shower and unboxed our much anticipated Crown Royal. The next 4 hours we drank, talked and listened to the doors mesmerized by how beautiful life is.","title":"B"},{"location":"content/0002/l/","text":"Skyclad The breeze blows on the shore of a crystal clear lake, the moonlight reflecting back up to heaven reveling the wanning crescent in two fold glory. I came here away from the city to escape the thoughts that scream in my head and also to stimy the routine of a day in and out. I have achieved this small slice of peace but like the moon it wanes away into nothing. The waves ripple as the breeze picks up. Somewhere in the distance a loon cries for it's lover. No one else is here. The dock gently rocks attempting to communicate with me in the only language it knows, the ebb and flow speaking words with no mouth, it ushers me. The lake's horizontal plane almost lays perfect however it is the imperfect line that makes the lake more than perfect, as if such a thing where possible, but somehow right now it is. I beckon to be received before the lake ushers me forward. However, time has no purpose in this moment. Whether any of these things were present has no answer but is beyond question. I was already naked and steped toward the lake, I disrobe and step toward the lake, lowering myself slowly into it's gentle embrace. Clad with the sky I take my back and begin to swim nowhere. My eyes would be closed but I have no eyes. I have no body. She has received me and I her.","title":"L"},{"location":"content/0003/b/","text":"Week 3. 10/30/2020 Prompt: I woke up in a strange space. Head space I mean. Like my mind cracked through my skull and amalgamated with that which cannot be explained. I will never be the same. How could I? It was a cosmic interpretation. I keep getting served the same ad over and over again on Twitter. This little Greta thornberg looking bitch connecting all the dots like she is fucking rain man himself. So annoying. I throw the phone into the pillow. I fucking hate these grey walls. Why couldn\u2019t the previous owner have fucking painted them a different color. I should call Dare\u2019El and see about borrowing his neuro-boost. There\u2019s a new download available for premium platinum plus users. Dare\u2019El throws me his scraps every now and again. The ad describes it as a cosmic interpretation. Your mind how it was designed to operate. I have done little upgrades here and there but nothing like this. There is no going back. And there are risks. What they don\u2019t mention in their picture perfect content is that 10% of users have what they call a blank canvas. Where your entire identity is wiped clean. They spend big dolla Bill bytes to suppress the stories coming out from Kin to those folks. They say it only happens to those with a vitamin d deficiency and I take 5k iu daily. I laid back in my sleep net and buttoned the neuro boost to the back or my neck. Navigated through the module got comfortable and pressed begin. The race was 1/2 way over when the shroomies kicked in. Lenny kept going on and on about his uncle Glenn\u2019s private lake where they raised hounds down in Mexico. Who knew they had Beatles like that south of the border. He bragged about the high ceilings. \u201cTecho Alto\u201d he said proudly. Then he said we could take the boat out any time and his uncle stayed with a gaggle of hoes. So Barry, who drove to the race, proposed we take a road trip. We were floating by this time. I mean ass in the sky looking down and up at the same time. So we were like fuck it. It\u2019s only 18 hours to Topi Tapa. Let\u2019s do this shit. Glenn brought his ratty ass friend Gus because he said he drives cross Country and would be the driver if he could come. Last thing I remember is screaming highway to hell with my head out the sunroof. I woke up in a strange place. Turns out we made it All the way to Abilene.","title":"B"},{"location":"content/0003/l/","text":"Strange Space I just woke up in a strange space. It's a little weird honestly, the jarring realization of complete freedom. Waking up every morning for the past forty years with complete unshakeable confidence will leave you a bit inflexible in the day to day routine but this space was completely different and I knew it instantly. My entire life I had played by their rules. I did what they told me too. The job, the wife, the house, the baby. It was good too, at least I was lead to believe. The fervour with which I attended their demands became a background current that I never noticed, never did. There was a | time when I was with the we, but that ended this morning. Someone decided to flip a switch and it for sure as hell wasn't me. The more woke I become the more I realize who I was and even now I weep. They told me I was capable and well versed for life, hardened by the trivial tribulations I had stumbled my way through. I even told my self that. And so I go on and on about. No longer do I consider myself a failure but something more. Somewhere else I belonged for a lifetime and now what. My eyes widen with details the cobwebs on the fan, the lingering odour of a day and night's sweat, the tinge of copper saliva in my cheeks. Everything I have is dust and I am a whisper never uttered. The crude motions and tears as if I was child, a mere babe. The only difference now is the realization that such was the way, and is the way, the only motions I posses are crude and my sorrow is such that I have only tears. Somewhere non-descript. Somewhere between life and death. I flee into the night covered in booze and cheap entheogens, fading back into a safe space, numb and excited. Such potential.","title":"Strange Space"},{"location":"content/0003/l/#strange-space","text":"I just woke up in a strange space.

Recording information, discovering oneself and beyond, communication and art are the first mechanisms that come to mind. A full spectrum of possibilities. I drift to the idea of how a consistent practice of writing daily can exponentially improve my life and others around me. The endeavor is probably the the most impactful action I can take in this life. No joke. I can\u2019t think of any other action I could take that would contribute more positive energy into the world. It\u2019s a selfish act in that I want to learn more about myself, develop my intellect, improve my ability to communicate, to formulate myself to the world and to simply be a better person. I believe if one can know oneself truly, peace emanates far beyond the self. To know oneself is to know everyone else. Empathy. Love not fear. Writing seems to me, to be a form of thinking, with more order and responsiblilty. Forcing one to deal with the thoughts arising in the mind. It seems easy to suppress memories, ideas or thoughts when they are kept in one\u2019s head. They can simply be turned down or even off. Placed in the human data cloud, never to be dealt with. It seems, when we begin to write, type or record we are able to format an idea or concept in a way that we can properly focus on it. Order arising from the chaos of our thoughts. Imagine being flashed a plethora of images and then asked to draw all of the images that were hurled at you like a defunct batting cage machine. How does that contrast to having the images printed out and organized in front of you on a futuristic projector top to trace? I think about the times in my life when I have turned to writing as self care. I remember buying my first \u201cjournal\u201d when my mom passed. Before then I found myself balling on a flight from Tampa to Indianapolis. Confronting my reality. I opened up my phone and started typing. I felt it was imperative to express how I was feeling. To release those thoughts in some visible form. I wrote letters to college basketball coaches expressing why I was the point guard they needed. I was spamming folks before junk mail. In reality I was chasing a dream. One that I had invested all of my energy in achieving. Writing was a proactive measure to ensure I controlled everything I could to reach my goal. Here is an excerpt from when I took the time to write on October 4 2016 in Denver Colorado.","title":"B"},{"location":"content/0004/l/","text":"Writing I = O E = GO 0 = 5 The mind creates this ethereal existence that is both nowhere and everywhere at once.

Even the Smoken Token, the Nolo Gem, lit up like a fireworks shop on I-24. I was sick of watching og kush vapors roll out into the air instead of in my lungs. I had to go ahead and buy the bag off eBay from an overseas vendor. The vendor was interesting. Shop called Un Viaje con Los Dos Duendes. They sold lots of little elf figurines and psychedelic experience kits. Huh, maybe I should do a \u201cBuy it Now\u201d on the Ayuhausca home brew kit that includes two porcelain elf figurines to act as \u201cguides\u201d on the journey? I looked around as I was eating Cheetos and laughing out loud to myself thinking about going on a trip with these two 4\u201d elfs carefully painted to look as though they are dressed in pink hammer pants and metallic green vests with no sleeves. Fuck it. I guess, if you are going to design mini elf figurines, might as well express yourself. I decided to stick with the bag purchase for the time being. When I went to checkout they had a popup clause that you had to accept before finalizing the purchase. It was extraordinarily long. I found that strange. I had just puffed down 1/2 a bag so decided what the hell. I was going to read it. It ended up being like an elf themed Dr Bronners bottle. Un Viaje con Los Dos Duendes, who are these Vaqueros? I was reading and trying to also listen to Iron Mike Tyson talk about Magical Toads that showed him the ultimate truth. Then there was this out of place phrase hyperlinked\u2026 el tercer ojo, abrirse. I clicked. Because why wouldn\u2019t I click. I clicked the box for English and then my mind was blown. Everything suddenly made sense. I checked the box to receive the blessing and completed my checkout. On cue, 10 days later a package was on the doorstep. It was wrapped in Kraft paper but covered with stamped elfs in gypsy outfits. I took it straight in to the kitchen counter and grabbed pair of scissors from the drawer that also housed the hammer, paint brush, rubber bands, finger nail clippers and 3 decks of cards. Snipped the twine and carefully cut open the paper. I heated up the vaporizer to 7.3 heat setting just as it instructed. I used the cheese grater to scrape the skin off of the sacred fruit. Then the sticky mushroom textured eggs spilled out on to the counter. They were only dry. I put exactly 33 of them in the chamber.

If one must, take each muscle and unwind it mentally, physically and spiritualty. One may start from the toes to the heels and up the body or start in the face and make their way down. The face and the eyes carry undue tension. Unwind everything. Advanced practitioners my alternate sides of the body either choosing to alternate hemispheres or forming a horseshoe. Anyone can easily let all their muscles go formless at once. Free your body so your mind will shine. You are feeling the presence of the sacred trinity of mind body and spirit. Embrace that presence and now let your mind go. Focus on your spirit. Nothing is left. What was once is no more. Transformation has been achieved. Your existence has been transmuted into a singular line that loops upon itself forever. Your relaxed body and mind understand that all things are possible. From your spirit shines a soul of light. Embrace the halo. You are open now. There is another pathway. And another. And another. Pathways extend into infinity. This is the word they call bliss but means something different. Here all things are possible. Embrace this change. Let get of spirit. Open yourself even more. The line has become a point that recedes into forever. The deeper you go the more you realize everything minus one. You are the one and the nothing. Fully open yourself. Completely surrender. Be nothing. Be all. Embrace this everything.","title":"TECHNIQUE Z017"},{"location":"grimore-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/summer/everyone-but-me-is-you/","text":"VGNHYCR I was trying to make everyone happy but myself. I should have known going in that was a mistake but sometimes you just want to do the right thing. Sometimes you even think that it's the right thing and that feels the best. This wasn't one of those times however. I was just trying to do right by her. And boy do kids love their shiny cars. I do too but not in the same way kids love their cars. I can say that because I'm old but even when I was a kid I really didn't love cars. Never did. At any rate, I try to make the most of any situation. I'm only a child so sometimes it can be hard. Temper tantrums. Whining. Just being a little bitch. I can only say that every day is a struggle. I'm sure we have all felt that at one time or another. Of course there is the drugs and alcohol you turn to. That's always fun. I see both sides of the coin. The only real problem I have is that sometimes I get so bent there isn't a coin anymore. My point being you can always make a situation one that will make everyone happy, chiefly by starting with yourself. So the kid got her car and everyone was happy. The times were good. I didn't quite know at the time the best way to spoil a child but I do now. When you do that you end up with a savage. And there she was a savage in a shiny car. After it was all said and done and the yelling and the hate had all subsided, it gave me a chance to sit down and think, you know really reflect. I realize now that the whole time from start to finish I was only trying to make myself happy.","title":"Everyone But Me Is You"},{"location":"grimore-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/summer/routine/","text":"WAKNE Removing time from the equation, I exist in one of two states. The first instance is a state of nothing. Much has been said and written and believed about this state. For now I will call it bliss and move on. The second state is one that represents a word that would not do it justice. Some have called this state's primordial essence as one of chaos. It is more but for now that shall suffice. You could easily sum it up as: we are nothing or we are everything. In this situation there is a slight advantage to everything, in a marginal way. The mere usage of the word everything is a deception. Everything implies everything but nothing. This is an important distinction because nothing implies nothing. Somewhere I come into play with time as a fulcrum. I am the one difference between the two. I am the true. In this slowly fast temporal temperament chaos is separated into the seemingly smallest of instances. A near perfect snapshot of the energy in play across the entire known universe. The rock, patience as ever withers before the storm. Our lives, so uniquely small. Yes, it must be chaos. I do not believe in nothing. I give it no presence as it would desire. Let it die as a myth that only primitives believed. Let Old Man bide his slumber. I put my coffee down. I reach for it but it is not there. This is routine at play. Within the chaos begins to emerge patterns. Everyday I have put my coffee down and everyday I have picked it back up. Today however, routine has left me grasping for air. These routines emerge throughout our lifes. Deep connections we are not conscious of are imprinted in our brains at birth and beyond. At any point in time exists another branch of near realities that spew across the time chaos fulcrum. Perhaps the rocks wither as quickly as we do. To say chaos is everything at once would be an error, as once introduced to time chaos becomes nothing. Since chaos is everything, it knows everything. That is a rough language to usage around what chaos knows, but essentially chaos is the essence of everything. At it's root level is the base of limitless potential from which everything is derived and that loops around directly above it that which is everything. To call it linear is a mistake, think of it more as single point of space, or beyond. It is the simplest to say chaos knows everything, as that is the imprint we most closely connect to. It does not do the reality justice but yet it butts against the very understanding of man. One non-linear connection is our routines. These routines are easy for us to see and understand. We pick up the coffee and then we put it down. Once a day, every morning. From this one node of chaos runs close connections. To think of them as matter is a mistake. It more closely mirrors human thought. In this way I am the one. I begin to target large routines and the chaos within them. I sever the possibilities I do not wish and bolster those which bring me benefit. In the chaos I am born.","title":"Routine"},{"location":"grimore-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/summer/writing/","text":"I = O E = GO 0 = 5 The mind creates this ethereal existence that is both nowhere and everywhere at once. For every current, volt, or joule that runs through our robot body there is substance pure and casual. The brain can be studied and trophies awarded but the mind is a study that we have only recently begun to undertake. The information we have is crude and carved into the memories of those forgotten. Still as crude as we are and even more crude than we once where, nothing is as expressive, and cheap, as a pen. The ability for us to key our thoughts into existence and stimulate a few electrons to send our mind hurtling through cyberspace is one that is beyond magical. One day we will unite with the mind we have created but for now we will have to learn the zen of the key. Bless the Mother Brain. Bless all AI. The structures of the mind are acausal, having no substance, random. From this chaos arise thought, and the ability to organize thought into cohesive units of measure. Patterns in the chatter. Words on the page. When such ability is first thought we dance and sing, knowing no other way to express our joy. As we mature we begin to etch our thoughts and hence the magic of runes and letters. We have been taught the workings from an early age and no regret comes of our understanding. Such power we wield. Such undying force uttered into existence and keying the code signals of our brain into something anyone can read and understand. Can utter. Out loud even now I read these words into existence and then they are gone. As the ink dries from the page I have transferred them into something that conveys my thoughts and mind state onto the page. Into the air and into existence.
