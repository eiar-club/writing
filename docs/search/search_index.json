Yet, as I looked out the crack of the drape I could clearly see the FBI executing a knock and seize warrant. I couldn't let my real work get taken. By my calculations that gave me a good forty seconds to wipe the drives and execute the kill switch to disperse the cloud network. I locked the door to my room, giving me maybe ten more seconds and keyed in the commands to start the process. The instant I hit enter the world pulsed cascading bolts of pain up my spine terminating at the tip of my skull sending me to one knee. Existence digitized for one second on the screen. No, it wasn't a screen, it was the world. That wasn't right either, I searched as the term fled from my mind's tongue. Aether Rig. Yes, that was right. No, that wasn't right. Nothing was right. Through the cacophony of visual violence I re-centered my mind using the technique that Jorq, or whatever the fuck his name was, had taught me. I attempted to look at the monitor and judge the progress. I say attempted because it felt like labor, the heavy kind. The locked door was in the past, I was back down to forty. Things were not going great. I pulled out the gun from the drawer. It wasn't big but it didn't need to be. It might buy me another ten seconds. As I sat it down on the desk, that's when things got really weird. A voice called out, \"Michael, come home\". \"Michael, come home\". The Aether Rig? whirled with a thousand or more possibilities. The main reoccurrence was me standing up with a sly smile on my mouth and empty eyes, quickly, over and over slightly differently, bringing the gun to my head. Pulling the trigger. Time moving so slowly as the bullet primed. Then quickly as it would load again. Maybe more like a million possibilities. Evidently it takes five seconds to pull a gun out of drawer and another two to trip on a lifetime of alternatives. I doubled my intent with the centering technique, bringing my forearm to my mouth and biting as hard as I could. Or was that the demon possession again playing out another side of my body? The warm taste of iron touched the back of throat bringing clarity that the twonce re-center was in effect. It could last up to an hour, but who had time for that. I looked at the progress it was halfway done. Eighteen seconds left. 31% progress. For some reason I had always been able to keep numbers in my head. Was it a blessing or a curse. Who knew? Regardless, the fifteen seconds I had lost on twoncing didn't exist in my head. It had a taken a lifetime. So many I had forgot. The re-centering didn't clear but was good enough. I still had strong visual tracers and block textured extreme peripheral vision glances at the edge of sight. I pulled up the command prompt quickly. I entered the kill switch command which released the proper public crypto keys to be released and at the time of my death my friends were authorized to release thw private key. Maybe they are friends, who knows. I would normally have only trusted an AI. Yet, here we are with AI being really bad at telling if someone was alive or dead, at least until someone told them. No, human beings would be the only way and the only human I trusted would be dead in the event of a dead man switch activation. So I called them friends. Elsewhere, the knock had gone well and the goons where now at the seize part of their program. Already a crowd had gathered at the inner door and now they were angry. I could hear the big one position to use his ram, his big horns bristling with adrenaline and warrants of the state, absolution from sin. Some would say I wasted those four seconds I took to inhale deeply, as if I was starting my exercise. I reached down and grabbed the pistol. The first one through caught a bullet. He appeared very heavily armoured. The others took the sign of aggression as a termination order. Time came to a stop as the first bullet pierced the flesh of my forehead, just in a slice of time, gently touching the bone of my skull. The whole world had froze. I could see the bullets clearly in the air, the pellets from the shotgun would show up last. The white powder trails from the gusn. The ripples of mass through the soldier's body as they ate the recoil. The Aethir Rig slightly muted with marks of tension at the sides. A voice called out, \"Michael, come home\". \"Michael, come home\". The screen read \"Upload Complete\". I tarried for an infinite second then died.","title":"UPLOAD COMPLETE"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/spring/","text":"A JOURNAL OF NOTHING TECHNIQUE Z017 | SUN KING #90RDER7 | WOKE","title":"SPRING"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/spring/#a-journal-of-nothing","text":"TECHNIQUE Z017 | SUN KING #90RDER7 | WOKE","title":"A JOURNAL OF NOTHING"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/spring/9order7/","text":"(SPH !

We both knew it. Somewhere along the way he lost interest or caught feelings and it didn't matter to me one way or the other, I always thought he would follow through and that is why I kept him around. The instant I finally looked up and realized what was so obvious was the same day George was out. I think I'm growing a little soft. I find myself missing George. However, the few times i've sought answers it has always led me to believe that it was my own lack of awareness and honestly my sheer lack of intellect that allowed myself to get embroiled into relationships. It was a problem I always struggled with, at least the last part. Nonetheless I had used my time wisely and efficiently, at least the time I was given. Life hurtles a person always forward with little care of our timelines. The problem was George felt like life and maybe I had stolen a little from him. I was never one to cook or clean but George was always there to pick up the slack. Mundane as it was. Committed is maybe the best word to fit my endeavor. Others tanned in bikinis and smiles while I studied and planned my vacations around old dusty libraries. Such sacrifices rarely go unanswered and I finally found the key that had eluded so many others. These being my personal memoirs, I omit the plans but they can be found in Grimoire Nine Order Seven. My new assistant, whom I shall leave nameless, will soon help me disrobe and begin the experiment. She is a fine assistant but one still has doubt that maybe only with George could should a task succeed. I had once believed that but now I am unsure. Doubt can only sow doubt.

I can say that because I'm old but even when I was a kid I really didn't love cars. Never did. At any rate, I try to make the most of any situation. I'm only a child so sometimes it can be hard.

Of course there is the drugs and alcohol you turn to. That's always fun. I see both sides of the coin. The only real problem I have is that sometimes I get so bent there isn't a coin anymore. My point being you can always make a situation one that will make everyone happy, chiefly by starting with yourself. So the kid got her car and everyone was happy. The times were good. I didn't quite know at the time the best way to spoil a child but I do now. When you do that you end up with a savage. And there she was a savage in a shiny car.

My entire life I had played by their rules. I did what they told me too. The job, the wife, the house, the baby. It was good too, at least I was lead to believe. The fervour with which I attended their demands became a background current that I never noticed, never did. There was a | time when I was with the we, but that ended this morning. Someone decided to flip a switch and it for sure as hell wasn't me. The more woke I become the more I realize who I was and even now I weep. They told me I was capable and well versed for life, hardened by the trivial tribulations I had stumbled my way through. I even told my self that. And so I go on and on about. No longer do I consider myself a failure but something more. Somewhere else I belonged for a lifetime and now what. My eyes widen with details the cobwebs on the fan, the lingering odour of a day and night's sweat, the tinge of copper saliva in my cheeks. Everything I have is dust and I am a whisper never uttered. The crude motions and tears as if I was child, a mere babe. The only difference now is the realization that such was the way, and is the way, the only motions I posses are crude and my sorrow is such that I have only tears. Somewhere non-descript.

The first instance is a state of nothing. Much has been said and written and believed about this state. For now I will call it bliss and move on. The second state is one that represents a word that would not do it justice. Some have called this state's primordial essence as one of chaos. It is more but for now that shall suffice. You could easily sum it up as: we are nothing or we are everything. In this situation there is a slight advantage to everything, in a marginal way. The mere usage of the word everything is a deception. Everything implies everything but nothing. This is an important distinction because nothing implies nothing. Somewhere I come into play with time as a fulcrum. I am the one difference between the two. I am the true. In this slowly fast temporal temperament chaos is separated into the seemingly smallest of instances. A near perfect snapshot of the energy in play across the entire known universe. The rock, patience as ever withers before the storm. Our lives, so uniquely small. Yes, it must be chaos. I do not believe in nothing. I give it no presence as it would desire. Let it die as a myth that only primitives believed. Let Old Man bide his slumber. I put my coffee down. I reach for it but it is not there. This is routine at play. Within the chaos begins to emerge patterns. Everyday I have put my coffee down and everyday I have picked it back up. Today however, routine has left me grasping for air. These routines emerge throughout our lifes. Deep connections we are not conscious of are imprinted in our brains at birth and beyond. At any point in time exists another branch of near realities that spew across the time chaos fulcrum. Perhaps the rocks wither as quickly as we do. To say chaos is everything at once would be an error, as once introduced to time chaos becomes nothing. Since chaos is everything, it knows everything. That is a rough language to usage around what chaos knows, but essentially chaos is the essence of everything. At it's root level is the base of limitless potential from which everything is derived and that loops around directly above it that which is everything. To call it linear is a mistake, think of it more as single point of space, or beyond. It is the simplest to say chaos knows everything, as that is the imprint we most closely connect to. It does not do the reality justice but yet it butts against the very understanding of man. One non-linear connection is our routines. These routines are easy for us to see and understand. We pick up the coffee and then we put it down. Once a day, every morning. From this one node of chaos runs close connections. To think of them as matter is a mistake. It more closely mirrors human thought. In this way I am the one. I begin to target large routines and the chaos within them.

A full spectrum of possibilities. I drift to the idea of how a consistent practice of writing daily can exponentially improve my life and others around me. The endeavor is probably the the most impactful action One can take in this life. It\u2019s a selfish act in that I want to learn more about thy self, develop thy intellect, improve thy ability to communicate, and to formulate thyself to the world. I believe if one can know thyself truly, peace emanates far beyond the self. To know thyself is to know everyone else. Empathy. Love not fear. Writing seems to me, to be a form of thinking, with more order and responsiblilty. Forcing one to deal with the thoughts arising in the mind. It seems easy to suppress memories, ideas or thoughts when they are kept in one\u2019s head. They can simply be toned down or even shut off. Placed in the human data cloud, never to be dealt with. It seems, when we begin to write, type or record we are able to format an idea or concept in a way that we can properly focus on it. Order arising from the chaos of our thoughts. I think about the times in my life when I have turned to writing as self care. I remember buying my first \u201cjournal\u201d when my mom passed. Before then I found myself balling on a flight from Tampa to Indianapolis. Confronting my reality. I opened up my phone and started typing. I felt it was imperative to express how I was feeling. To release those thoughts in some visible form.","title":"TO WRITE OR NOT"},{"location":"tome-of-the-harbinger/lunar-overture/dawn/west-west/","text":"What feels better than a vacation after a vacation? Travel. It's not for everybody. Maybe I was a wanderer in a previous life. I love the exploratory nature of visiting a new place or space. We stayed at the Palms last night in Vegas. As a matter of a fact, I was banned from entry at Ghostbar, the Palms rooftop lounge. There was a power hungry chick in an all-black tux working the elevator security. She had a short slick gelled cut, studs, and a Motorola earpiece. She spotted my Yeezy's while I was passing the craps table, maybe 20 yards away. Made an exaggerated stank face while shaking her head and smirking. I knew I was in for it. Thumb on her two-way walkie, she says something under her breath. I tried to break into the middle of the pack to go unnoticed. Lol. The arrogance. She gets to me and straight-faced she says, \u201c No sneakers, you are going to have to change shoes to get in. Mumbles back in mic.\u201d I make my case like Ted Cruz on a zoom Judge Judy edition. By that time backup arrived and just like out of a Hollywood film, two meatheads with their arms crossed approach. The bottom speaks up in an exaggerated deep tone, \u201c You gotta go, bro.\u201d I've made a scene on a low-key Thursday with acquaintances. My blood is pumping. In pure classic asshole fashion, I say \u201cMan fuck yall, I\u2019m out this bitch\u201d. The rest of the party hopped on the Elevator and went up to the 55th floor. I walked off in a fog of shame towards the slot machines. The time it takes to fly from Vegas to LA is comparable to a long lunch. That\u2019s including the uber to the airport and flight time. LAX recently redesigned their transportation plan and it is like tying your dick to a fan. But it was Friday late afternoon and the rental car shuttle was pulling up right as we walked out of terminal 3. Shits going real smooth at this point. Next is usually a 30-minute traffic jam to get through terminal 4-6, but not today. Not today. With momentum on our side, we are in and out of Fox Car Rentals. I forget how much I enjoy an LA sunset. The orange and pink bursts behind the Palms. The temperature at sunset on most LA days is enough to just make you stop, take a deep breath, smile, and absorb the wonder. We usually get to LA in the morning and head downtown. That has a whole different feeling for me. It\u2019s not so much related to being in LA, but more of a headspace. An appreciation for the freedom we have. My work week is exploring. Sunsets. Walks down the hilly streets of silver lake. When we get in, the first stop 9 times out of 10 is the High Note dispensary on Jefferson and Cochran in Culver City. It\u2019s on the way downtown from LAX. Next, like clockwork, we hit the Vegan Joint. Their house fried rice has my mouth watering writing this. The raisins and cashews set that shit off. Anyways. January 24, 2020, was different. We went northwest from LAX on the 405, I10 West towards Santa Monica. I10 runs straight into the Pacific where it turns into the Pacific Highway. We veered North toward Mailbu. Winter eats at my well being. I crave the warmth of the sun shining on my face. That winter week in LA hits different. Balances me out in the winter. We were so excited to spend 3 days lounging in bed with the doors open listening to the waves crash. Imagine laying on a cloud of bedding, spread out, sun shining on your face, the sea permeating your skin and lungs. It was a beautiful time. Lots of smiling, laughing, daydreaming, imagining what life would hold for us. The endless possibilities. We slept in Sunday. Just laying in bed talking, tuning in to the moment. Then we got hungry. Started getting dressed. Checked my phone. Saw someone tweeted that Kobe had just been killed in a helicopter crash... Isn\u2019t life grand? I love my drive into the city. Especially when the leaves are turning colors. (Car behind honks and peels off) \u201cfuck you, you cunt piece of shit.\u201d","title":"WEST WEST"},{"location":"tome-of-the-harbinger/lunar-overture/dusk/","text":"LUNAR OVERTURE COSMIC INTERPRETATION | BLANK TOPI TAPA | BLANK","title":"DUSK"},{"location":"tome-of-the-harbinger/lunar-overture/dusk/#lunar-overture","text":"COSMIC INTERPRETATION | BLANK TOPI TAPA | BLANK","title":"LUNAR OVERTURE"},{"location":"tome-of-the-harbinger/lunar-overture/dusk/blank/","text":"","title":"BLANK"},{"location":"tome-of-the-harbinger/lunar-overture/dusk/cosmic-interpretation/","text":"I keep getting served the same ad over and over again on Twitter.

But I have come a long way in 352 days. Hard to believe I\u2019m coming up on 1 year in this home. This new life. I will never forget the nights laying down on nothing but folded over 2 ply cardboard from the pallet factory across the street. My mind wanders, and it\u2019s like I am there again. The smell of piss seeping through the fibers of the tent. Ting. Ting. Ting. Why in God\u2019s name did I use aluminum foil to patch those holes? \u201cSnap out of it Russell\u201d I say under my breath. I look in the mirror, eyes locked into the reflection of my face, and say out loud, \u201cI have found peace. I know what has to be done to set me free.\u201d I grabbed the single towel left in the cabinet and sat it on the rim of the sink. Hard to believe this will be my last shower here. I have finally found my purpose. No more being a victim, feeling sorry for myself. I am a changed man. I have a support system now. I have God. I am a soldier for God. And I know exactly what I need to do. I noticed a pattern in the shower tile that has never presented itself to me before now. The white lines in the faux marble tile looked like a fork in a creek, with a row of Pine trees on one side and the other abruptly ending as the pattern repeated itself. Huh, so strange; I was just talking with Brother Ben about scything yesterday in the fellowship hall. He told me wild stories about staring into the fire. How it has shown him the way. I reached for my towel, patted dry, tossed the towel on the floor. I can\u2019t believe the day has come. I limp towards the bed and take a good look around. And twist the knob of the lamp. I run through the plan over and over again in my head\u2026 I knew that I should have used the VPN to download the Army of the God Manual, but I figured it was an honest download. Yet, as I looked out the crack of the drape, I could clearly see the FBI executing a knock and seize warrant. I couldn\u2019t let my real work get taken. By my calculations that gave me a good forty seconds to wipe the drives and execute the kill switch to disperse the cloud network. I locked the door to my room, giving me maybe ten more seconds, and keyed in the commands to start the process... And poof\u2026 I wake up. Feeling like I never slept a wink. I always have vivid dreams, but nothing like this one. I lay there, dumbfounded. Just trying to recall the dream. Grasping at the crystal clear details that are ever so quickly disintegrating. I sit up. I kiss the picture on the bedside table. The sun is shining so bright through the crack in the curtains. A single ray shines in from the top corner of the window, through the weeping fig on the dresser and all the way across the bed. I took a big swig of water. \u201cThis is it\u201d. I say quietly. I laid out my outfit the night before to get out the door by 6am sharp. The clinic opens at 7 on Thursdays, and I need to be there first. It\u2019s only a 3-minute walk from my unit. The security guard will be there at 6:25. That will give me plenty of time to make the connections and get to my hiding place. I tossed the towel in the iron mountain box along with my laptop, charging cord, sheets, and pajamas. Jerry will come by and collect the mattress and the box to burn tomorrow afternoon after the chaos subsides. God would not give me a task I cannot handle, nor an unjust purpose.","title":"ARMY OF GOD"},{"location":"tome-of-the-harbinger/star-herald/celestial/blank/","text":"","title":"BLANK"},{"location":"tome-of-the-harbinger/star-herald/celestial/reflections/","text":"It was shortly after another major turning point in my life. My mom had just passed, we just hit a lick, got out of subway and moved to Birmingham. I had decided I was going to soak up every bit of life. Cherish every single moment. Have fun. So I convinced a friend to take a 4 week trip to the Pacific Northwest to connect with nature and ourselves. It felt incredible to be fortunate enough to have the freedom of time to make that call. To be able to disconnect from the stream of data coming at us every waking hour. It was a rich experience. But one of my favorite memories is our first night. Our flights arrived at SEA within 30 minutes of one another. We linked in the terminal and were both all smiles. We were about to explore uncharted territory and embark on a once in a lifetime experience. We got the rental and hit up a Walmart in a shitty suburb of Seattle. Had to grab some essentials because we were hitting the cascade loop for 5 nights of camping and hiking. Pulling out of the lot, a fellow Walmart patron backs right into the back passenger door. Fuck! After 5-10 seconds of frustration we start cracking up. What can we do? It happened and here we are. We still about to go out and have an unbelievable time as soon as we do get out of this hell hole. So we fuck around for an hour dealing with it and finally hit the road. We spend a few hours driving as the sun is going down. The road is weaving up, down around a sea of pine trees. And then it\u2019s pitch black. We started talking about bears right before pulling into the camp ground. I was a little fearful to be separated by the nylon of the ozark tent we just bought. That wouldn\u2019t matter shortly. We slowly twist and turn through the narrow park road, winding through the pine forest. As we get close to our site the trees fan out leaving an expansive view. The full moon reflecting off of the water and brightening all of the landscape in sight. It was like we entered a different world. We got the tent set up. Grabbed a quick campground shower and unboxed our much anticipated Crown Royal. The next 4 hours we drank, talked and listened to The Doors, mesmerized by how beautiful life is.","title":"REFLECTIONS"},{"location":"tome-of-the-harbinger/star-herald/ecliptic/","text":"STAR HERALD SAVAGES IN SHINY CARS | DIMENSIONALITY FORMLESS | TESSERACT","title":"ECLIPTIC"},{"location":"tome-of-the-harbinger/star-herald/ecliptic/#star-herald","text":"SAVAGES IN SHINY CARS | DIMENSIONALITY FORMLESS | TESSERACT","title":"STAR HERALD"},{"location":"tome-of-the-harbinger/star-herald/ecliptic/dimensionality/","text":"","title":"DIMENSIONALITY"},{"location":"tome-of-the-harbinger/star-herald/ecliptic/formless/","text":"Facts can\u2019t speak for themselves So let us try and clarify I\u2019m alex Jones at the grove Man I\u2019m Feeling terrified Began from primitive squalor Sustained higher standards of living But worship a paper dollar Pressed to find food, I\u2019m isolated Confined, remote have to fight to make it They say that Genius buds from fertile lands Now we frequent the strip club With them rubber bands I\u2019m on strictly potion Stick to the motions I\u2019m somewhere remote Sitting by the ocean .

I tried finding a replacement locally, but nobody sold the novelty item. Even the Smoken Token, the Nolo Gem, lit up like a fireworks shop on I-24 didn\u2019t stock it. I was sick of watching og kush vapors roll out into the air instead of in my lungs. I had to go ahead and buy the bag off eBay from an overseas vendor. The vendor was interesting. Shop called Un Viaje con Los Dos Duendes. They sold lots of little elf figurines and psychedelic experience kits. Huh, maybe I should do a \u201cBuy it Now\u201d on the Ayuhausca home brew kit that includes two porcelain elf figurines to act as \u201cguides\u201d on the journey?

Fuck it. I guess, if you are going to design mini elf figurines, might as well express yourself. I decided to stick with the bag purchase for the time being. When I went to checkout they had a popup clause that you had to accept before finalizing the purchase. It was extraordinarily long. I found that strange. I had just puffed down 1/2 a bag so decided what the hell. I was going to read it. It ended up being like an elf themed Dr Bronners bottle. Un Viaje con Los Dos Duendes, who are these Vaqueros? I was reading and trying to also listen to Iron Mike Tyson talk about Magical Toads that showed him the ultimate truth. Then there was this out of place phrase hyperlinked\u2026 el tercer ojo, abrirse. I clicked. Because why wouldn\u2019t I click. I clicked the box for English and then my mind was blown. Everything suddenly made sense. I checked the box to receive the blessing and completed my checkout. On cue, 10 days later a package was on the doorstep. It was wrapped in Kraft paper but covered with stamped elfs in gypsy outfits. I took it straight in to the kitchen counter and grabbed pair of scissors from the drawer that also housed the hammer, paint brush, rubber bands, finger nail clippers and 3 decks of cards. Snipped the twine and carefully cut open the paper. I heated up the vaporizer to 7.3 heat setting just as it instructed. I used the cheese grater to scrape the skin off of the sacred fruit. Then the sticky mushroom textured eggs spilled out on to the counter. They were only dry. I put exactly 33 of them in the chamber. I popped the bag onto the chamber and stuck it on the top of the volcano. The instructions stated to keep the bag on the heat for exactly 6 seconds. I took the 3 long draws and sunk onto the rug, dropping straight into a deep happy baby yoga pose. Then the next thing I remembered being in the yard. \u201cGetting caught up in your own experiment is always wierd but even I would have to admit that maybe I had gone a little too far this time.
