LSING) George had told me there was no way in hell he was going to follow through with this and I would have to find someone else. And I did. I told him I would and I thought we had an understanding but evidently there was still some bad blood there. I could feel it. I wanted this so bad and he was merely along for the ride. We both knew it. Somewhere along the way he lost interest or caught feelings and it didn't matter to me one way or the other, I always thought he would follow through and that is why I kept him around. The instant I finally looked up and realized what was so obvious was the same day George was out. I think I'm growing a little soft. I find myself missing George. However, the few times i've sought answers it has always led me to believe that it was my own lack of awareness and honestly my sheer lack of intellect that allowed myself to get embroiled into relationships. It was a problem I always struggled with, at least the last part. Nonetheless I had used my time wisely and efficiently, at least the time I was given. Life hurtles a person always forward with little care of our timelines. The problem was George felt like life and maybe I had stolen a little from him. I was never one to cook or clean but George was always there to pick up the slack. Mundane as it was. Committed is maybe the best word to fit my endeavor. Others tanned in bikinis and smiles while I studied and planned my vacations around old dusty libraries. Such sacrifices rarely go unanswered and I finally found the key that had eluded so many others. These being my personal memoirs, I omit the plans but they can be found in Grimoire Nine Order Seven. My new assistant, whom I shall leave nameless, will soon help me disrobe and begin the experiment. She is a fine assistant but one still has doubt that maybe only with George could should a task succeed. I had once believed that but now I am unsure. Doubt can only sow doubt. Getting caught up in your own experiment is always weird but even I would have to admit that maybe I had gone a little too far this time.","title":".#90rder7"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/spring/skyclad/","text":"The breeze blows on the shore of a crystal clear lake, the moonlight reflecting back up to heaven reveling the wanning crescent in two fold glory. I came here away from the city to escape the thoughts that scream in my head and also to stimy the routine of a day in and out. I have achieved this small slice of peace but like the moon it wanes away into nothing. The waves ripple as the breeze picks up. Somewhere in the distance a loon cries for it's lover. No one else is here. The dock gently rocks attempting to communicate with me in the only language it knows, the ebb and flow speaking words with no mouth, it ushers me. The lake's horizontal plane almost lays perfect however it is the imperfect line that makes the lake more than perfect, as if such a thing where possible, but somehow right now it is. I beckon to be received before the lake ushers me forward. However, time has no purpose in this moment. Whether any of these things were present has no answer but is beyond question. I was already naked and stepped toward the lake, I disrobe and step toward the lake, lowering myself slowly into it's gentle embrace. Clad with the sky I take my back and begin to swim nowhere. My eyes would be closed but I have no eyes. I have no body. She has received me and I her.","title":"Skyclad"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/spring/technique-z017/","text":"[Theta Binaural] [F/LS] [F/HSE] The Fears. The Overthinking. The worries. You have to let it go. There is another pathway. Convert your mind as if the tabula rasa. The blank slate. Once experienced, Gnosis is easy to identify. It is from this state that one truly becomes open. As we go through this exercise one will begin to feel more relaxed. Take this opportunity to embrace the change and become more relaxed. If one must, take each muscle and unwind it mentally, physically and spiritualty. One may start from the toes to the heels and up the body or start in the face and make their way down. The face and the eyes carry undue tension. Unwind everything. Advanced practitioners my alternate sides of the body either choosing to alternate hemispheres or forming a horseshoe. Anyone can easily let all their muscles go formless at once. Free your body so your mind will shine. You are feeling the presence of the sacred trinity of mind body and spirit. Embrace that presence and now let your mind go. Focus on your spirit. Nothing is left. What was once is no more. Transformation has been achieved. Your existence has been transmuted into a singular line that loops upon itself forever. Your relaxed body and mind understand that all things are possible. From your spirit shines a soul of light. Embrace the halo. You are open now. There is another pathway. And another. And another. Pathways extend into infinity. This is the word they call bliss but means something different. Here all things are possible. Embrace this change. Let get of spirit. Open yourself even more. The line has become a point that recedes into forever. The deeper you go the more you realize everything minus one. You are the one and the nothing. Fully open yourself. Completely surrender. Be nothing. Be all. Embrace this everything.","title":"TECHNIQUE Z017"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/summer/everyone-but-me-is-you/","text":"VGNHYCR I was trying to make everyone happy but myself. I should have known going in that was a mistake but sometimes you just want to do the right thing. Sometimes you even think that it's the right thing and that feels the best. This wasn't one of those times however. I was just trying to do right by her. And boy do kids love their shiny cars. I do too but not in the same way kids love their cars. I can say that because I'm old but even when I was a kid I really didn't love cars. Never did. At any rate, I try to make the most of any situation. I'm only a child so sometimes it can be hard. Temper tantrums. Whining. Just being a little bitch. I can only say that every day is a struggle. I'm sure we have all felt that at one time or another. Of course there is the drugs and alcohol you turn to. That's always fun. I see both sides of the coin. The only real problem I have is that sometimes I get so bent there isn't a coin anymore. My point being you can always make a situation one that will make everyone happy, chiefly by starting with yourself. So the kid got her car and everyone was happy. The times were good. I didn't quite know at the time the best way to spoil a child but I do now. When you do that you end up with a savage. And there she was a savage in a shiny car. After it was all said and done and the yelling and the hate had all subsided, it gave me a chance to sit down and think, you know really reflect. I realize now that the whole time from start to finish I was only trying to make myself happy.","title":"Everyone But Me Is You"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/summer/routine/","text":"WAKNE Removing time from the equation, I exist in one of two states. The first instance is a state of nothing. Much has been said and written and believed about this state. For now I will call it bliss and move on. The second state is one that represents a word that would not do it justice. Some have called this state's primordial essence as one of chaos. It is more but for now that shall suffice. You could easily sum it up as: we are nothing or we are everything. In this situation there is a slight advantage to everything, in a marginal way. The mere usage of the word everything is a deception. Everything implies everything but nothing. This is an important distinction because nothing implies nothing. Somewhere I come into play with time as a fulcrum. I am the one difference between the two. I am the true. In this slowly fast temporal temperament chaos is separated into the seemingly smallest of instances. A near perfect snapshot of the energy in play across the entire known universe. The rock, patience as ever withers before the storm. Our lives, so uniquely small. Yes, it must be chaos. I do not believe in nothing. I give it no presence as it would desire. Let it die as a myth that only primitives believed. Let Old Man bide his slumber. I put my coffee down. I reach for it but it is not there. This is routine at play. Within the chaos begins to emerge patterns. Everyday I have put my coffee down and everyday I have picked it back up. Today however, routine has left me grasping for air. These routines emerge throughout our lifes. Deep connections we are not conscious of are imprinted in our brains at birth and beyond. At any point in time exists another branch of near realities that spew across the time chaos fulcrum. Perhaps the rocks wither as quickly as we do. To say chaos is everything at once would be an error, as once introduced to time chaos becomes nothing. Since chaos is everything, it knows everything. That is a rough language to usage around what chaos knows, but essentially chaos is the essence of everything. At it's root level is the base of limitless potential from which everything is derived and that loops around directly above it that which is everything. To call it linear is a mistake, think of it more as single point of space, or beyond. It is the simplest to say chaos knows everything, as that is the imprint we most closely connect to. It does not do the reality justice but yet it butts against the very understanding of man. One non-linear connection is our routines. These routines are easy for us to see and understand. We pick up the coffee and then we put it down. Once a day, every morning. From this one node of chaos runs close connections. To think of them as matter is a mistake. It more closely mirrors human thought. In this way I am the one. I begin to target large routines and the chaos within them. I sever the possibilities I do not wish and bolster those which bring me benefit. In the chaos I am born.","title":"Routine"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/summer/writing/","text":"I = O E = GO 0 = 5 The mind creates this ethereal existence that is both nowhere and everywhere at once. For every current, volt, or joule that runs through our robot body there is substance pure and casual. The brain can be studied and trophies awarded but the mind is a study that we have only recently begun to undertake. The information we have is crude and carved into the memories of those forgotten. Still as crude as we are and even more crude than we once where, nothing is as expressive, and cheap, as a pen. The ability for us to key our thoughts into existence and stimulate a few electrons to send our mind hurtling through cyberspace is one that is beyond magical. One day we will unite with the mind we have created but for now we will have to learn the zen of the key. Bless the Mother Brain. Bless all AI. The structures of the mind are acausal, having no substance, random. From this chaos arise thought, and the ability to organize thought into cohesive units of measure. Patterns in the chatter. Words on the page. When such ability is first thought we dance and sing, knowing no other way to express our joy. As we mature we begin to etch our thoughts and hence the magic of runes and letters. We have been taught the workings from an early age and no regret comes of our understanding. Such power we wield. Such undying force uttered into existence and keying the code signals of our brain into something anyone can read and understand. Can utter. Out loud even now I read these words into existence and then they are gone. As the ink dries from the page I have transferred them into something that conveys my thoughts and mind state onto the page. Into the air and into existence.
