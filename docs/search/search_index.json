The first instance is a state of nothing. Much has been said and written and believed about this state. For now I will call it bliss and move on. The second state is one that represents a word that would not do it justice. Some have called this state's primordial essence as one of chaos. It is more but for now that shall suffice. You could easily sum it up as: we are nothing or we are everything. In this situation there is a slight advantage to everything, in a marginal way. The mere usage of the word everything is a deception. Everything implies everything but nothing. This is an important distinction because nothing implies nothing. Somewhere I come into play with time as a fulcrum. I am the one difference between the two. I am the true. In this slowly fast temporal temperament chaos is separated into the seemingly smallest of instances. A near perfect snapshot of the energy in play across the entire known universe. The rock, patience as ever withers before the storm. Our lives, so uniquely small. Yes, it must be chaos. I do not believe in nothing. I give it no presence as it would desire. Let it die as a myth that only primitives believed. Let Old Man bide his slumber. I put my coffee down. I reach for it but it is not there. This is routine at play. Within the chaos begins to emerge patterns. Everyday I have put my coffee down and everyday I have picked it back up. Today however, routine has left me grasping for air. These routines emerge throughout our lifes. Deep connections we are not conscious of are imprinted in our brains at birth and beyond. At any point in time exists another branch of near realities that spew across the time chaos fulcrum. Perhaps the rocks wither as quickly as we do. To say chaos is everything at once would be an error, as once introduced to time chaos becomes nothing. Since chaos is everything, it knows everything. That is a rough language to usage around what chaos knows, but essentially chaos is the essence of everything. At it's root level is the base of limitless potential from which everything is derived and that loops around directly above it that which is everything. To call it linear is a mistake, think of it more as single point of space, or beyond. It is the simplest to say chaos knows everything, as that is the imprint we most closely connect to. It does not do the reality justice but yet it butts against the very understanding of man. One non-linear connection is our routines. These routines are easy for us to see and understand. We pick up the coffee and then we put it down. Once a day, every morning. From this one node of chaos runs close connections. To think of them as matter is a mistake. It more closely mirrors human thought. In this way I am the one. I begin to target large routines and the chaos within them. I sever the possibilities I do not wish and bolster those which bring me benefit. In the chaos I am born.","title":"ROUTINE"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/fall/upload-complete/","text":"I knew that I should have used the VPN to download the Army of the God Manual but I figured it was an honest download. Yet, as I looked out the crack of the drape I could clearly see the FBI executing a knock and seize warrant. I couldn't let my real work get taken. By my calculations that gave me a good forty seconds to wipe the drives and execute the kill switch to disperse the cloud network. I locked the door to my room, giving me maybe ten more seconds and keyed in the commands to start the process. The instant I hit enter the world pulsed cascading bolts of pain up my spine terminating at the tip of my skull sending me to one knee. Existence digitized for one second on the screen. No, it wasn't a screen, it was the world. That wasn't right either, I searched as the term fled from my mind's tongue. Aether Rig. Yes, that was right. No, that wasn't right. Nothing was right. Through the cacophony of visual violence I re-centered my mind using the technique that Jorq, or whatever the fuck his name was, had taught me. I attempted to look at the monitor and judge the progress. I say attempted because it felt like labor, the heavy kind. The locked door was in the past, I was back down to forty. Things were not going great. I pulled out the gun from the drawer. It wasn't big but it didn't need to be. It might buy me another ten seconds. As I sat it down on the desk, that's when things got really weird. A voice called out, \"Michael, come home\". \"Michael, come home\". The Aether Rig? whirled with a thousand or more possibilities. The main reoccurrence was me standing up with a sly smile on my mouth and empty eyes, quickly, over and over slightly differently, bringing the gun to my head. Pulling the trigger. Time moving so slowly as the bullet primed. Then quickly as it would load again. Maybe more like a million possibilities. Evidently it takes five seconds to pull a gun out of drawer and another two to trip on a lifetime of alternatives. I doubled my intent with the centering technique, bringing my forearm to my mouth and biting as hard as I could. Or was that the demon possession again playing out another side of my body? The warm taste of iron touched the back of throat bringing clarity that the twonce re-center was in effect. It could last up to an hour, but who had time for that. I looked at the progress it was halfway done. Eighteen seconds left. 31% progress. For some reason I had always been able to keep numbers in my head. Was it a blessing or a curse. Who knew? Regardless, the fifteen seconds I had lost on twoncing didn't exist in my head. It had a taken a lifetime. So many I had forgot. The re-centering didn't clear but was good enough. I still had strong visual tracers and block textured extreme peripheral vision glances at the edge of sight. I pulled up the command prompt quickly. I entered the kill switch command which released the proper public crypto keys to be released and at the time of my death my friends were authorized to release thw private key. Maybe they are friends, who knows. I would normally have only trusted an AI. Yet, here we are with AI being really bad at telling if someone was alive or dead, at least until someone told them. No, human beings would be the only way and the only human I trusted would be dead in the event of a dead man switch activation. So I called them friends. Elsewhere, the knock had gone well and the goons where now at the seize part of their program. Already a crowd had gathered at the inner door and now they were angry. I could hear the big one position to use his ram, his big horns bristling with adrenaline and warrants of the state, absolution from sin. Some would say I wasted those four seconds I took to inhale deeply, as if I was starting my exercise. I reached down and grabbed the pistol. The first one through caught a bullet. He appeared very heavily armoured. The others took the sign of aggression as a termination order. Time came to a stop as the first bullet pierced the flesh of my forehead, just in a slice of time, gently touching the bone of my skull. The whole world had froze. I could see the bullets clearly in the air, the pellets from the shotgun would show up last. The white powder trails from the gusn. The ripples of mass through the soldier's body as they ate the recoil. The Aethir Rig slightly muted with marks of tension at the sides. A voice called out, \"Michael, come home\". \"Michael, come home\". The screen read \"Upload Complete\". I tarried for an infinite second then died.","title":"UPLOAD COMPLETE"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/spring/","text":"A JOURNAL OF NOTHING TECHNIQUE Z017 | SUN KING #90RDER7 | WOKE","title":"SPRING"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/spring/#a-journal-of-nothing","text":"TECHNIQUE Z017 | SUN KING #90RDER7 | WOKE","title":"A JOURNAL OF NOTHING"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/spring/9order7/","text":"(SPH ! LSING) George had told me there was no way in hell he was going to follow through with this and I would have to find someone else. And I did. I told him I would and I thought we had an understanding but evidently there was still some bad blood there. I could feel it. I wanted this so bad and he was merely along for the ride. We both knew it. Somewhere along the way he lost interest or caught feelings and it didn't matter to me one way or the other, I always thought he would follow through and that is why I kept him around. The instant I finally looked up and realized what was so obvious was the same day George was out. I think I'm growing a little soft. I find myself missing George. However, the few times i've sought answers it has always led me to believe that it was my own lack of awareness and honestly my sheer lack of intellect that allowed myself to get embroiled into relationships. It was a problem I always struggled with, at least the last part. Nonetheless I had used my time wisely and efficiently, at least the time I was given. Life hurtles a person always forward with little care of our timelines. The problem was George felt like life and maybe I had stolen a little from him. I was never one to cook or clean but George was always there to pick up the slack. Mundane as it was. Committed is maybe the best word to fit my endeavor. Others tanned in bikinis and smiles while I studied and planned my vacations around old dusty libraries. Such sacrifices rarely go unanswered and I finally found the key that had eluded so many others. These being my personal memoirs, I omit the plans but they can be found in Grimoire Nine Order Seven. My new assistant, whom I shall leave nameless, will soon help me disrobe and begin the experiment. She is a fine assistant but one still has doubt that maybe only with George could should a task succeed. I had once believed that but now I am unsure. Doubt can only sow doubt. Getting caught up in your own experiment is always weird but even I would have to admit that maybe I had gone a little too far this time.","title":".#90rder7"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/spring/sun-king/","text":"","title":"SUN KING"},{"location":"grimoire-zero/a-journal-of-nothing/spring/technique-z017/","text":"[Theta Binaural] [F/LS] [F/HSE] The Fears.

I should have known going in that was a mistake but sometimes you just want to do the right thing. Sometimes you even think that it's the right thing and that feels the best. This wasn't one of those times however. I was just trying to do right by her. And boy do kids love their shiny cars. I do too but not in the same way kids love their cars. I can say that because I'm old but even when I was a kid I really didn't love cars. Never did. At any rate, I try to make the most of any situation. I'm only a child so sometimes it can be hard. Temper tantrums. Whining. Just being a little bitch. I can only say that every day is a struggle. I'm sure we have all felt that at one time or another. Of course there is the drugs and alcohol you turn to. That's always fun. I see both sides of the coin. The only real problem I have is that sometimes I get so bent there isn't a coin anymore. My point being you can always make a situation one that will make everyone happy, chiefly by starting with yourself. So the kid got her car and everyone was happy. The times were good. I didn't quite know at the time the best way to spoil a child but I do now. When you do that you end up with a savage. And there she was a savage in a shiny car. After it was all said and done and the yelling and the hate had all subsided, it gave me a chance to sit down and think, you know really reflect.

It's a little weird honestly, the jarring realization of complete freedom. Waking up every morning for the past forty years with complete unshakeable confidence will leave you a bit inflexible in the day to day routine but this space was completely different and I knew it instantly. My entire life I had played by their rules. I did what they told me too. The job, the wife, the house, the baby. It was good too, at least I was lead to believe. The fervour with which I attended their demands became a background current that I never noticed, never did. There was a | time when I was with the we, but that ended this morning. Someone decided to flip a switch and it for sure as hell wasn't me. The more woke I become the more I realize who I was and even now I weep. They told me I was capable and well versed for life, hardened by the trivial tribulations I had stumbled my way through. I even told my self that. And so I go on and on about. No longer do I consider myself a failure but something more. Somewhere else I belonged for a lifetime and now what. My eyes widen with details the cobwebs on the fan, the lingering odour of a day and night's sweat, the tinge of copper saliva in my cheeks. Everything I have is dust and I am a whisper never uttered. The crude motions and tears as if I was child, a mere babe. The only difference now is the realization that such was the way, and is the way, the only motions I posses are crude and my sorrow is such that I have only tears. Somewhere non-descript.
